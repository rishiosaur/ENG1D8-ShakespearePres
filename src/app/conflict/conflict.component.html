<h1>Conflict</h1>
<p>England and London during Elizabethan times was full of conflict, as a result of it being overrun with crime, divided because of religion, and politically deviant.</p>

<h2>Riots</h2>

<p>England has had many rough points in its history, but the division of the country around the Protestant and Catholic sub-religions remains one of the hardest hits the country has taken. London in particular was affected; it was the hub of commerce and political affairs.<br><br> As a result, it also had one of the biggest population counts in England at the time, and the majority were Christians. Queen Elizabeth was the last of the House of Tudors, and the previous monarchies had made sure that the Church was all but eradicated from popular London society. When Queen Elizabeth came into power, this issue was at its highest.<br />
  <br>King Henry the 7th was one of the driving forces in this battle to eradicate the church, and this idea spread through the various monarchies of the era.<br><br> In London at the time, the Church a basic necessity for many involved with it, seeing as it was a very generous organization in its day; providing food and shelter for the poor. As a result, many felt that their religious views coincided with the Church&rsquo;s, and also felt that they would uphold those religious values.<br />
  However, Queen Elizabeth did something aggravated many: she turned the split religion state of London into one that was purely Protestant. This caused many, many problems, which we shall get to later, but right then, the people were rioting because of that.</p>

<p>However, not all of the riots were religion-based, of course. Many of them came from less-than-interesting &ldquo;problems&rdquo;. Many of the riots in the streets were from middle-class citizens complaining about the lowlifes of London, and to eradicate them. Specifically, their chants were about the eradication of &ldquo;prostitutes, foreigners, and gentlemen's workers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>War</h2>

<p>In Early Modern England, war and geopolitical conflict was also an unfortunate reality for many. During Elizabethan times, there were three main European wars that were going on, the first of which was the Spanish War. Noting that these wars were started mainly because of religion and Christianity will be beneficial.<br />
  The Anglo-Spanish war is the most well-known Elizabethan war, but fun fact: it technically didn&rsquo;t even exist: it was not an official proceeding!<br>
<br/>
  Anyways, the Spanish war was started in part because of religious zest and part opportunity for Spain. As you already know, London was not in a very good time during the Elizabethan Era. it was ridden with crime and a failing economy, not to mention the various diseases. Spain, on the other hand, was doing amazing! It had just defeated French Protestants with its French Catholic allies, and Spain was in a state of ecstasy. This made Spain one of the greatest superpowers in Europe at the time, and they still needed to advance their empire, and the opportunity to take over England would have been idiotic to pass up. As a result, an enormous war started up, and would not finish for 19 years. However, England back in the 1600s was stubborn, and for all 19 of those years, they refused to give up, under the leadership of Queen Elizabeth I, and came out victorious.<br />
  There were two other wars, and both of them were in Ireland, and they are known to popular culture as the Desmond Rebellions and the Tyrone Rebellions. Both of these were in succession of each other, and were in progress for about 3 decades, from the 1560s-90s.<br />
  <br>The first of those, the Desmond Rebellion, was sparked because of English Protestant and Irish Catholic rivalry. England at the time had little power over the neighbouring country of Ireland, and sought to conquer it, in their pursuit of making the United Kingdom. They had already established a settlement in Dublin, but they felt that they needed to expand. This expansion necessitated a move up north, which is where the land of Munster was located. This land was under the control of Catholic Irish citizens, who were in the Desmond Dynasty.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was the leader of Early Modern London, and she was known for her diplomacy. However, many do not know of the campaigns she led against, and for other countries, which directly affected London and the life of its people. During Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime, there was an enormous amount of conquest in the race to colonize the New World, and England was one of the driving factors of that race.</p>

<p>England also faced a lot of rivalry on the same land as theirs; most notably, the rivalry with Genghis Khan and the Turks. In the late 1400s (note the time period), the Turks were conquering all around Asia, to grow their land, causing about 870 000 deaths. Queen Elizabeth I was luckily a very diplomatic leader, and so formed a partnership with the Turks. This was favoured all throughout the land of Britain, as not dying is much, much better than dying. This alliance also allowed Britain to engage with other countries in war, like the Russians. This alliance and its history was also reflected in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Othello, where in the first act, a battle between the Turks and Venetians was enacted.</p>

<h2>Effects on Shakespeare</h2>
<p>All of this is good, but we still haven&rsquo;t talked much about how these conflicts and riots affected Shakespeare as a person and as an artist. However, Shakespeare has made some striking references to these events going on in England at the time. <br />
  In Macbeth, the unpredicted killings were reminiscent of the political corruption and unprecedented violence in London streets at the time.<br />
  In Merchant of Venice, the conflict between the Christians and Jews is symbolic of the moral issues that the Christians faced in contemporary London.<br />
  All throughout his work, Shakespeare was telling stories that related to the streets and times of London, and this was for a very specific reason: to enforce superiority of the Tudor house of monarchs over opposing monarchies, like the Scots.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As has been shown, the violence and bloodiness in Elizabethan Britain at the time greatly affected Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, and much of it wouldn&rsquo;t be there if it hadn&rsquo;t been for those ideas. Many of the tragedies and comedies in his work revolved around death, pain, suffering, war, and jealousy from Macbeth to Othello. The violence during the Elizabethan Era helped influence Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters and even several of his historical plays including the likes of &ldquo;The Tragedy of Julius Caesar&rdquo;. <br />
