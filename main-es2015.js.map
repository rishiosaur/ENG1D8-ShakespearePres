it being overrun with crime, divided because of religion, and politically deviant.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Riots</h2>\\n\\n<p>England has had many rough points in its history, but the division of the country around the Protestant and Catholic sub-religions remains one of the hardest hits the country has taken. London in particular was affected; it was the hub of commerce and political affairs.<br><br> As a result, it also had one of the biggest population counts in England at the time, and the majority were Christians. Queen Elizabeth was the last of the House of Tudors, and the previous monarchies had made sure that the Church was all but eradicated from popular London society. When Queen Elizabeth came into power, this issue was at its highest.<br />\\n  <br>King Henry the 7th was one of the driving forces in this battle to eradicate the church, and this idea spread through the various monarchies of the era.<br><br> In London at the time, the Church a basic necessity for many involved with it, seeing as it was a very generous organization in its day; providing food and shelter for the poor. As a result, many felt that their religious views coincided with the Church&rsquo;s, and also felt that they would uphold those religious values.<br />\\n  However, Queen Elizabeth did something aggravated many: she turned the split religion state of London into one that was purely Protestant. This caused many, many problems, which we shall get to later, but right then, the people were rioting because of that.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, not all of the riots were religion-based, of course. Many of them came from less-than-interesting &ldquo;problems&rdquo;. Many of the riots in the streets were from middle-class citizens complaining about the lowlifes of London, and to eradicate them. Specifically, their chants were about the eradication of &ldquo;prostitutes, foreigners, and gentlemen's workers.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<h2>War</h2>\\n\\n<p>In Early Modern England, war and geopolitical conflict was also an unfortunate reality for many. During Elizabethan times, there were three main European wars that were going on, the first of which was the Spanish War. Noting that these wars were started mainly because of religion and Christianity will be beneficial.<br />\\n  The Anglo-Spanish war is the most well-known Elizabethan war, but fun fact: it technically didn&rsquo;t even exist: it was not an official proceeding!<br>\\n<br/>\\n  Anyways, the Spanish war was started in part because of religious zest and part opportunity for Spain. As you already know, London was not in a very good time during the Elizabethan Era. it was ridden with crime and a failing economy, not to mention the various diseases. Spain, on the other hand, was doing amazing! It had just defeated French Protestants with its French Catholic allies, and Spain was in a state of ecstasy. This made Spain one of the greatest superpowers in Europe at the time, and they still needed to advance their empire, and the opportunity to take over England would have been idiotic to pass up. As a result, an enormous war started up, and would not finish for 19 years. However, England back in the 1600s was stubborn, and for all 19 of those years, they refused to give up, under the leadership of Queen Elizabeth I, and came out victorious.<br />\\n  There were two other wars, and both of them were in Ireland, and they are known to popular culture as the Desmond Rebellions and the Tyrone Rebellions. Both of these were in succession of each other, and were in progress for about 3 decades, from the 1560s-90s.<br />\\n  <br>The first of those, the Desmond Rebellion, was sparked because of English Protestant and Irish Catholic rivalry. England at the time had little power over the neighbouring country of Ireland, and sought to conquer it, in their pursuit of making the United Kingdom. They had already established a settlement in Dublin, but they felt that they needed to expand. This expansion necessitated a move up north, which is where the land of Munster was located. This land was under the control of Catholic Irish citizens, who were in the Desmond Dynasty.</p>\\n\\n<p>Queen Elizabeth was the leader of Early Modern London, and she was known for her diplomacy. However, many do not know of the campaigns she led against, and for other countries, which directly affected London and the life of its people. During Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime, there was an enormous amount of conquest in the race to colonize the New World, and England was one of the driving factors of that race.</p>\\n\\n<p>England also faced a lot of rivalry on the same land as theirs; most notably, the rivalry with Genghis Khan and the Turks. In the late 1400s (note the time period), the Turks were conquering all around Asia, to grow their land, causing about 870 000 deaths. Queen Elizabeth I was luckily a very diplomatic leader, and so formed a partnership with the Turks. This was favoured all throughout the land of Britain, as not dying is much, much better than dying. This alliance also allowed Britain to engage with other countries in war, like the Russians. This alliance and its history was also reflected in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Othello, where in the first act, a battle between the Turks and Venetians was enacted.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Effects on Shakespeare</h2>\\n<p>All of this is good, but we still haven&rsquo;t talked much about how these conflicts and riots affected Shakespeare as a person and as an artist. However, Shakespeare has made some striking references to these events going on in England at the time. <br />\\n  In Macbeth, the unpredicted killings were reminiscent of the political corruption and unprecedented violence in London streets at the time.<br />\\n  In Merchant of Venice, the conflict between the Christians and Jews is symbolic of the moral issues that the Christians faced in contemporary London.<br />\\n  All throughout his work, Shakespeare was telling stories that related to the streets and times of London, and this was for a very specific reason: to enforce superiority of the Tudor house of monarchs over opposing monarchies, like the Scots.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>As has been shown, the violence and bloodiness in Elizabethan Britain at the time greatly affected Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, and much of it wouldn&rsquo;t be there if it hadn&rsquo;t been for those ideas. Many of the tragedies and comedies in his work revolved around death, pain, suffering, war, and jealousy from Macbeth to Othello. The violence during the Elizabethan Era helped influence Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters and even several of his historical plays including the likes of &ldquo;The Tragedy of Julius Caesar&rdquo;. <br />\\n</p>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<h1>Culture</h1>\\n<h2>Sumptuary laws</h2>\\n\\nDuring the Elizabethan era there were laws on what you were allowed to eat, wear and buy to regulate social hierarchies in london, theses laws were called the Sumptuary laws.\\n<br/><br/>\\n\\n<h2>Clothings</h2>\\nClothing in london showed the wealth of the family or person.\\n<br/><br/>This also lead to a lot of social discrimination.\\n<br/><br/>They believed that the sumptuary laws were important because they protect fortunes, curb extravagance and make clear the necessary and appropriate distinction between the levels of society.\\n<br/><br/>For example, members of the royal family could wear clothing trimmed with ermine fur and nobles wore fancy clothes with silk, velvet and ruffled collars and sleeves.\\n<br/><br/>If someone was caught breaking the laws they would have to pay a small fee and a warning.\\n<br/><br/>Even though, this was a crucial law they could only trust the people would follow the laws.\\n<br/><br/>For the reason that  there was no such thing as a “costume police”, thus it was rare for anyone to get caught wearing clothing of a higher class.\\n<br/><br/>Thus, this law was a loss cause.\\n<br/><br/>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<h1>Economy</h1>\\n\\nLondon’s economy was experiencing a surge of economic reform and growth during the Elizabethan era, partly due to its increase in population and the dramatic incorporation of playhouses, theatre, and drama becoming a very lucrative and publically accessible activity.\\n<br><br/>\\nEven with the plagues and diseases hitting the citizens of London, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries noticed a surge in population with 10 000 citizens migrating to London.\\n<br><br/>\\nThis was in part due to the increase of higher wages and the growing merchant business and prosperity.\\n<br><br/>\\nThe Elizabethan Times also brought peace with foreign nations, attracted man businesses, and increased the development of infrastructure and enterprises.\\n<br><br/>\\nShakesperea himself was of the middle class, but observed the lower class laborers and yeomen.\\n<br><br/>\\nMany of these labourers were able to afford basic necessities and accumulate more wealth.\\n<br><br/>\\nThis resulted in a higher standard of living where tourism and travel became big industries.\\n<br><br/>\\nIn fact, theatre Historian calculated that London playhouses, those including the Globe Theatre, had 50 million visitors alone annually.\\n<br><br/>\\nDespite this, the majority of the industry was Wool based, accounting for ¾ of england’s exports.\\n<br><br/>\\nLondon’s ports became the most important in all of Europe, inviting merchants and businesses.\\n<br><br/>\\nWool grew in demand due to its many applications and trends at the time.\\n<br><br/>\\nWith wool, the train industry, textiles, and craftsmanship significantly increased in supply and demand with higher quality and more competition.\\n<br><br/>\\nDue to the nature and demand of the wool and textile economy, the economic diversity in London became one-sided, forcing many smaller communities to become poverty-ridden.\\n<br><br/>\\nHowever, much of this growth was dominated by the Guild system, which we’ll get into later.\\n<br><br/>\\nThis left many farmers who made much of their wealth left to become labourers.\\n<br><br/>\\nProfessions including ranchers, laborers, merchants, and clerks would profit off of the wool industry while many farmers and yeomans would be left to die.\\n<br><br/>\\nSocial classes became a big controversy, often referenced by Shakespeare in several of his works, including Coriolanus, Henry VI, and the Merry Wifes of Windsor.\\n<br><br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial classes were thought be expression of status in society by God himself.\\n<br><br/>\\nThe system consisted of 6 classes, including the Monarch.\\n<br><br/>\\nNobility would be considered the second highest class consisting of subsections of the royal family.\\n<br><br/>\\nThey would be heavily connected with the Monarchy and at the time, 55 families would be considered Nobility.\\n<br><br/>\\nThen would follow Gentry (knights), Merchants, the Yeomen (the middle class on the fringe of poverty), and laborers (those who could not sustain families).\\n<br><br/>\\nThese classes could be changed through the monarchy, accumulating enough wealth, or even committing severe crimes.\\n<br><br/>\\nThe play <em>Romeo and Juliette</em> shows how class could come in between something as of true love.\\n<br><br/>\\n\\n\\nMuch of Shakespeare’s work in not in many cases directly referenced to the economy of London, but is subtle and includes messages on greed, power, and class systems.\\n<br><br/>\\nThe economic circumstances around him influenced his content from how London was shown in his plays, the representation of a common man, and the real life context it provided.\\n<br><br/>\\nThe play Macbeth depicts how the thirst for fame, fortune, and power can all lead to tyranny and evil.\\n<br><br/>\\nEven in Othello and the Merchant of Venice, the story was as much of a tragedy as it was a clash of economic competition and class.\\n<br><br/>\\nShakespeare’s home county Warwickshire in 1607 witnessed a series of riots against enclosure and the power surges and hierarchy created in London.\\n<br><br/>\\nHowever, it could not prevent the economic inequality that made farmers into labourers, land layoffs, and the control of their land and assets in a manner “equivalent to slavery”.\\n<br><br/>\\n\\n\\nIn the famous book, <em>Shakespeare and Economic Theory</em>, by David Hawkes, he believed that the way Shakespeare connected economic reality and challenged it with morality and ethics made his plays and stories so effective and welcomed by the audience.\\n<br><br/>\\nPlays such as Coriolanus introduce a divided class system where there is a common divide between the rich and poor using the analogy “body politic” to describe the relation between the governors and the governed.\\n<br><br/>\\nShakespeare could observe the economic circumstances around him with a high degree of accuracy and could create these hidden themes in his plays that would fundamental challenge the audience’s perspective on class, economy, and its ethical aspects.\\n<br><br/>\\n\\n\"","module.exports = \"<h1>Law in London</h1>\\n<p>The city of London, blooming with inequality and corruption, was a crime-filled with an immoral policing system, harsh punishments, and convoluted law and order system. </p>\\n\\n<h2>Creating Laws: </h2>\\n<p>  In this era, laws were made simply made and passed by Queen Elizabeth and her parliament. </p>\\n\\n<h2>Judicial System: </h2>\\n <p> The judicial system during the Elizabethan era was unfair and biased, with courts skewed in favor of the prosecution. </p>\\n\\n<p>When one was accused of crime, they were to remain in jail until their trial were to take place. </p>\\n\\n<p>The trial was always brief and in favor of the prosecution, the convicted fate would be decided by the judge and following thus, the sentence would be carried out. </p>\\n\\n<p>When noble blood were brought to court, they were treated different compared to the peasants and commoners. </p>\\n\\n<p>Noblement was in favor with the queen, so they would face a less severe punishment than the commoners for the same crime. </p>\\n\\n<h2>Punishments:</h2>\\n\\n<p>Policing and law enforcement during the Elizabethean era was problematic with a series of unorganized systems that while kept many citizens in check, contributed to a more fearful and dictatorial society. London lacked a formal police force but rather consisted of a system of different roles and responsibilities spread out based on internal roles. Sherriggs, wardens, beadles, constables, watchme, and bailiffs, reeves, and churchwardens, private men-at-arms, enforcers, and hired men carried different responsibilities and maintained order and control. This system was confusing, and had multiple lines of authority and ward jurisdictions. Ultimately, it led to corruption and bribe-giving, but in the name of the &ldquo;King&rdquo;, there were many who continued to maintain order, even through the harshest systems. </p>\\n\\n<p>Shakespeare conveyed this message to the audience with his immortal portrayal of the Wayward Constable Dogberry in his play, Much Ado About Nothing: </p>\\n\\n<p><em>Dogberry</em>: This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the prince&rsquo;s name.</p>\\n\\n<p>Second Watchman: How if a&rsquo; will not stand?</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Dogberry</em>: Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.</p>\\n\\n<p>Veges: If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince&rsquo;s subjects.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Dogberry</em>: True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&rsquo;s subjects.&mdash;You shall also make no noise in the streets; for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.</p>\\n\\n<p>Watchmen: We will rather sleep than talk. We know what belongs to a watch. </p>\\n\\n<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s past encounters and portrayal of the police force is effectively portrayed through his depiction of Dogberry being a lazy, corrupt, and unorthodox constable. Him, along with his group of watchmen, are ready to commit their lives to easiness and accepting bribes and commission. The view of Elizabethan contables might be exaggerated, but it is apparent through historical evidence and accounts that constables were inept, bumbling, and foolish. </p>\\n\\n<p>Punishments for those who broke the law were severe, with a trial being held and the fate of the criminal in the hands of the judge.
